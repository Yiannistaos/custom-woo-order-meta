A custom plugin designed to allow users to edit, add, or modify order item meta data within WooCommerce orders. Useful for shops that require extended order meta functionality.

The Custom WooCommerce Order Meta plugin provides store owners and developers the ability to seamlessly edit, add, or modify order item metadata within WooCommerce orders. Especially curated for WooCommerce shops that demand enhanced order metadata functionalities.

## Why This Plugin?

During routine operations, there might be times where order details, especially tax values, need to be modified post the creation of the order. One such scenario that led to the conception of this plugin was the necessity to update tax values in the `woocommerce_order_itemmeta` table for refunded orders post a VIES validation. This plugin simplifies that process, ensuring the WooCommerce workflow remains uninterrupted.
